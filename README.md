# aedes-cached-persistence

This repository is a fork from [moscajs/aedes-cached-persistence](https://github.com/moscajs/aedes-cached-persistence). 
The reason why the fork was necessary was that this repo is a dependency for [bolteu/aedes-persistence-redis](https://github.com/bolteu/aedes-persistence-redis) and contains some parts of logic that was causing scalability issues.
